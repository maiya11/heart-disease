Heart Disease Predictor
#**Heart Disease in the United States***

* Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

* One person dies every 34 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease.

* About 697,000 people in the United States died from heart disease in 2020—that’s 1 in every 5 deaths.

* Heart disease cost the United States about $229 billion each year from 2017 to 2018. This includes the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death.


Machine learning can be used to identify a person's risk for cardiovascular disease and aid in early treatment / prevention.

This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently, but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

Cleveland: 303 observations

Hungarian: 294 observations

Switzerland: 123 observations

Long Beach VA: 200 observations

Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations

Total: 1190 observations

Duplicated: 272 observations

Final dataset: 918 observations

Every dataset used can be found under the Index of heart disease datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository on the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/
